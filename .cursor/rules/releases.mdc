# Making a release
1. Update the "Unreleased" section in CHANGELOG.md
2. Based on the changes, run `poetry version major/minor/patch` to update the version in pyproject.toml based on the changes (breaking changes = major, features = minor, fixes = patch).
3. Update the "Unreleased" section in CHANGELOG.md to the new version with today's date.
4. Commit the changes in a new branch called "release/$(potery version -s)" with a message "Release vX.Y.Z".
5. Push the branch to the remote repository.
